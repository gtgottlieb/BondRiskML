import pandas as pd
from computing_excess_returns import compute_excess_returns_for_all_bonds

# Example usage
# 1) Read yields from an Excel (or CSV) with index_col=0 
#    so that the date is the row index
df_in = pd.read_excel("data-folder/Aligned_Yields.xlsx", index_col=0)

# 2) Suppose columns 0..359 => 1..360 months, 
#    and the 12-month yield is column 11 (by default).
df_ex = compute_excess_returns_for_all_bonds(df_in)


print(df_ex.describe())

# 3) Save to file if desired
#df_ex.to_excel("data-folder\Excess_Returns.xlsx")
